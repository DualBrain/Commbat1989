# Commbat1989

This project was started back in 1989 when I was attempting to create a clone
of a fantastic game I used to play on my TRS-80 Model 1

I originally experimented with both writing it in Quick Basic 4.5, and also
in Turbo C 2.0

Now I am attempting to finish the project, or at least get it to compile 27 years later...
